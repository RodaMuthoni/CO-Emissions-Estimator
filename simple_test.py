            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities since the 1800s.
            
            **Main causes:**
            - Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
            - Deforestation
            - Industrial processes
            - Agriculture
            
            **Key impacts:**
            - Rising global temperatures
            - Sea level rise
            - Extreme weather events
            - Ecosystem disruption

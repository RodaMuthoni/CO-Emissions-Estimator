🌍 CO₂ Emissions Estimator & Climate Impact Visualizer

> A lightweight, AI-powered web app that estimates individual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from daily activities and visualizes climate impact — supporting **SDG 13: Climate Action**.

📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to help individuals, NGOs, and government institutions understand how everyday actions (like transportation, electricity use, and fuel consumption) contribute to climate change.

By making carbon footprint data accessible and actionable, the tool empowers communities to make greener choices, advocate for policy change, and raise climate awareness — one small action at a time.

🎯 Target SDG

**SDG 13: Climate Action**
  - Promote education around climate change
  - Provide tools to calculate emissions at an individual or community level
  - Support data-driven advocacy for sustainable practices

💡 Problem Statement

Despite growing concern about climate change, many institutions and individuals lack:
- Accessible tools to estimate their CO₂ emissions
- Visual insights into how behavior affects the planet
- Actionable tips to make impactful changes

🚀 Solution Summary

This AI-powered web application offers:
- A **simple form** for entering everyday activities
- Real-time **CO₂ emissions estimation** using pre-trained regression models or emission factor coefficients
- **Data visualizations** of user impact
- **Tailored tips** to reduce emissions

🧩 Key Features (MVP)

✅ Input Categories
- Mode of transportation (car, flight, bus, etc.)
- Distance travelled (km or miles)
- Fuel or electricity consumption (litres/kWh)

✅ CO₂ Estimation Engine
- Based on **GHG Conversion Factors** from open datasets (e.g. UK Gov)
- Uses either:
  - Preloaded emission coefficients (for instant feedback)
  - Trained regression model (for more nuanced predictions)

✅ Visual Output
- Bar/line charts of emissions by category
- Comparison with average national emissions
- Personalized emission reduction tips

✅ Deployment
- **No login or database** required for MVP
- Hosted via **Streamlit Cloud** (or Render/Railway)

🧠 Use Cases

- **NGO's and companies**: Use in school/community climate workshops to teach carbon awareness
- **Governments**: Prototype public-facing carbon calculators
- **Individuals**: Track personal footprint and get tips to reduce it
